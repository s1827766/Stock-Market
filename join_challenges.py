"""
Type ONE required JOIN query at a time below, then run this file.
Do this 3 times total, once per required challenge -- replace the query,
save, run, screenshot the output, then move to the next challenge.

Run create_relational_copy.py first -- it builds stocks and
relational_prices from your existing prices table.

IMPORTANT: use relational_prices, not prices, in every query today.
prices does not have a stock_id column -- only relational_prices does.

Your 3 required challenges (see the Day 4 Material for full wording):
  1. JOIN stocks and relational_prices, showing only rows above a
     close price you choose.
  2. JOIN stocks and relational_prices, GROUP BY to count price rows
     per ticker.
  3. One original JOIN query using stocks and relational_prices.
